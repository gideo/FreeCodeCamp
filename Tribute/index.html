				<h2>Early Life</h2>
				<li><b>1912 - </b>Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
				<li><b>1926 - </b>Went to Sherborn School in Sherborne, Dorset. An atheletic personality, Turing would ride his bicycle 60 miles from Southampton to Sherborne.</li>
				<li><b>1927 - </b>Turing developed a love for mathematics early on, even grasping Einstein's works and Newton's laws of motions. Here he meets his first love, fellow pupil Christopher Morcom.</li>
				<li><b>1930 - </b>Christopher Morcom dies from bovine tuberculosis after drinking infected cow's milk. This affected Turing profoundly, driving him further into science and mathematics- a passion he shared with Morcom.</li>
				<li><b>1931-1934 - </b>Undergraduate at King's College in Cambridge, where he gained first-class honours in mathematics.</li>
				<li><b>1936-1938 - </b>Studied under Alonzo Church at Princeton University, after improving upon Church's lambda calculus proof ultimately becoming the Church-Turing thesis. He obtained his PhD from Princton and wrote his dissertation on the concept of ordinal logic and relative computing.</li>
				<h2>World War II</h2>
				<li><b> World War II - </b> Turing joins the war efforts in Bletchley Park, a wartime station dealing with cryptoanalysis. </li>
				<li><b>1941 - </b>Porposed to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke but later decided not to go through with it.</li>
				<li><b>1942 - </b>Traveled to the United States and worked with US cryptanalysts. During his trip he also assisted Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.</li>
				<li><b>1941 - </b>Along with cryptanalyst Hugh Alexander, Stuart Milner-Barry, and Gordon Welchman they work on breaking the Eniga machina by building upon the works of the Polish's cryptologic bomb. However the task proved difficult </li>
				<li><b>1945 - </b>Award the OBE by King George VI although his contributions remained undisclosed for many years. </li>
				<h2>Post-War</h2>
				<li><b>1948 - </b>Turing worked with his former colleague D. G. Champerowne to write a chess program that would be completed in 1950. He also invents the LU decomposition method in solving matrix equations.</li>
				<li><b>1952</b>Starts relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old man. After reporting a burglary, the police questioned Turing where he admits to having sexual relations with Murray. Homosexuality being a criminal offense at the time led to Turing being charged and arrested. In the case Regina v. Turing and Murray, Turing pleads guilty and was forced to undergo chemical castration.
				</li>
				<li><b>1954 - </b>Died from suicide by cyanide poisoning.</li>
